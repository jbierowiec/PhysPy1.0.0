# PhysPy1.0.0

**Description**: This is a python library I am developing for STEM students and academics alike to:

  - make accurate physics calculations 
  - have the option of plotting these results
  - outputting the units of these calculations 
  
This project is still in development and is solely done by me, @jbierowiec. 
For anyone interested in a collaboration or to use this library as a reference please email me at: jbierowiec@fordham.edu
